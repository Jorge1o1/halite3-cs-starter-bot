# Starter Kit

##TODO: Input validation in Constants.cs might be missing :P

## Halite III starter kit components
* MyBot.{extension}, a starter bot outline
* /hlt directory, which contains modifiable helper functions for your bot
* A Halite executable that enables local playtesting of your bot
* The scripts run_game.bat (Windows) and run_game.sh (MacOS, Linux)

## Testing your bot locally
* Run run_game.bat (Windows) and run_game.sh (MacOS, Linux) to run a game of Halite III. By default, these scripts run a game of your MyBot.exe bot vs. itself.  You can modify the board size, map seed, and the opponents of test games.

## Submitting your bot
* Zip your MyBot.{extension} file and /hlt directory together.
* Submit your zipped file here: https://beta.halite.io/play-programming-challenge
